Package tosi provides an implementation of RFC 1006.

The protocol is defined at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1006.
The implementation puts ISO/IEC 8072/8073 transport class 0
(with some minor modifications) on top of a TCP/IP connection, on port 102
by default, even if another port can be chosen.
ISO/IEC 8072/8073 are identical to ITU standards X.214 and X.224, defined at
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?id=3262
and
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?id=3264.

The external interface is based on the constructs defined in
the 'net' package, and in particular the basic interface provided
by the Dial, Listen, and Accept functions and the associated Conn
and Listener interfaces. Please refer to that package's documentation
for general informations on their usage and philosophy, it can be
found here: http://golang.org/pkg/net/.

The DialTOSI function connects to a server:

 tosiAddr, err := tosi.ResolveTOSIAddr("tosi", "192.168.1.1:80:100")
 if err != nil {
         // handle error
 }
 conn, err := tosi.DialTOSI("tosi", nil, tosiAddr)
 if err != nil {
         // handle error
 }
 fmt.Fprintf(conn, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n")
 status, err := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')
 // ...

A tosi address is composed by a TCP address and an optional
"transport selector (TSEL)" which can be an arbitrary sequence
of bytes. Thus "10.20.30.40:80:hello" is a valid address, and 'hello' is
the TSEL. The TCP port can be omitted, and in this case the default
value (102) will be used, as in "10.20.30.40::hello". The TSEL
can also be omitted, as in "10.20.30.40::".

The ListenTOSI function creates servers:

 tosiAddr, err := tosi.ResolveTOSIAddr("tosi", "192.168.1.1:80:100")
 if err != nil {
         // handle error
 }
 ln, err := tosi.ListenTOSI("tosi", tosiAddr)
 if err != nil {
         // handle error
 }
 for {
         conn, err := ln.Accept()
         if err != nil {
                 // handle error
                 continue
         }
         go handleConnection(conn)
 }
